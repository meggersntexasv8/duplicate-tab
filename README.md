Duplicate Tab

## Performance

Consumes minimal resources:

  * Runs as an [event page](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages#lifetime) rather than a background page. So there is no persistent process running.
  * Does not collect analytics.

## Third Party Notices

Icon is "[versions](https://octicons.github.com/icon/versions/)" from GitHub's [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/), rasterized with http://fa2png.io/r/octicons/versions/.
